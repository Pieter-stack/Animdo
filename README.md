<!--PROJECT DESCRIPTION-->
## About the Project

![image1][image1]

### Project Description
This app helps protect endangered animals and also helps researchers tag an animal quicker with the use of AI to speed up the tagging process to relieve as much stress from the animal by quickly tagging and releasing.

Users can adopt animals with tokens where the user will purchase tokens that will be directly donated to a non profit organization to help these animals, the user will be able to name their animal, feed them, play with them and improve their habitat. 

Users will also be able to gift adopted animals to freinds and family.

Being able to sign in with google and apple makes it easier for the user to get through the registration process and quickly adopt a lovable animal.

Animals can be tracked on a map and users can see how far their animal is from them in realtime.

### Built With

* [xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)

<!-- DEVELOPMENT PROCESS -->
## Development Process

The `Development Process` is the technical implementations and functionality done in the backend of the application.

### Implementation Process

#### Design Architecture
`SwiftUI` to design the pages used in Animdo.

#### Highlights

* One highlight was to `explore` and research more about endangered animals and also being able to help them.
* Being able to expand on the project and get the app for both user and researcher to intercat seamlessly together.
* Being able to expand on the project by using multiple new packages and services to create a fully responsive and ready for production app.

#### Challenges

* I struggled at first with the storekit `in app purchaces` but later got it working seamlessly.

### Reviews and Testing
The `Reviews and Testing` consists of `in class`, reviews.

#### Future Implementation

* Expand on a subscription based program for users to help animals monthly.
* Expand on the endangered list with even more animals to help.
* Implement live animal tracking with a research company.
